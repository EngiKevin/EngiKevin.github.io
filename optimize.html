            <p>We had an assignment in English which was to make a blog.            </p>
            <p>
 EngiKevin website accutally comes in clutch.
            </p>
            <p>While making version 11/version 12 of the trading bot, it got to the point where I actually had to
                incorporate organized code structure (usually it's to make it work first, and organization can be
                optional).
            </p>
            <p>An analogy for this is like annotating an article worksheet; the task is to complete it, and you could
                complete it in 3 minutes and understand it, or complete it in 8 minutes with annotations. But I mean I
                guess the colors and highlights make it look like that more was done (to show your boss). However, we
                have to optimize.
            </p>
            <p>But of course in this situation, restructuring had to be done.
            </p>

            <p>So essentially it was solving the issue for detecting a head and shoulders pattern at any zoom level of
                the graph. However, because of the way the code was structured, if you zoomed in a bit too much, it
                would detect no head and shoulders even if there was a viable one. This is because one part of the code
                detected the shoulder points and then checked to see if they meet a vertical threshold (essentially
                meaning if the shoulder points had a high enough distance vertically in proportion to the head).
                However, it was with that it would go to another section of the code to “fine tune” the points so they
                the highest or smallest value they could be locally in the respective sides.
            </p>
            <p>However, it is said that “theory can only take you so far,” so when I ran it, it gave an error.
            </p>
            <p>And then upon entire code overhauls, resequencing the code, and sorta “merging it” into one process, now,
                if you zoomed in…it somehow makes a head and shoulders pattern that doesn’t exist, or it gives an error.
            </p>
            <p>The work-reward curve is actually insane optimization, but for like irl. For instance, for some types of
                assignments, like if you were to get busywork (ex: making a family tree), the play is probably only stay
                working on it while the work-reward rate is still exponential/linear, but immediate dip once it
                plateaus. (much like having the knowledge of avoiding nested loops that are based on list size when it
                comes to something of large scale, as it would be O(n^2), you wouldn’t want to continue working on
                something to the point where your effort to reward returns are negligible (I mean unless maybe if it’s
                for the trading bot lol).
            </p>
            <div class="article-img">
                <img src="diminishing-returns.png" alt="">
            </div>




            <p>Personally, here’s a possible way to optimize to heck out of clearing out the busy work:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Having the boildercode pre made:
                <li style="list-style: none;font-size: 1.15em;">Have a group (the more people the better) in which the
                    assignments will be done in rotation. What I mean by rotation is that one person (chosen from spin
                    the wheel) does it and sends it to be used as a template. Of course the words will be edited. What I
                    mean by having a template is removing the need for copying and pasting a bunch of lines and
                    rectangles as it’ll be pre made.
                </li>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do the same amount of effort as what was put into creating the busywork assignment:
                <li style="list-style: none;font-size: 1.15em;"> When it comes to busywork, the effort ratio of what you
                    put in vs. what was put in to make it is usually like 5:1. And personally, that has to come down to
                    at least a 2:1 ratio. So when it’s a question like (this is a literal question I had btw) “what do
                    you think the meaning of this assignment was?” Of course I already know what my true answer to that
                    is…and you already know where my written answer for that is going to come from.
                </li>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p>However, this really only applies to short term things like a worksheet to fill out, and of course this
                is only 1 aspect of work efficiency. When it comes to long term things, there’s gotta be a continuous
                output of effort, as instead of a reward it’s sustaining and increasing a skill. As when you get too
                comfortable with something, you may as well be sleeping (based on what’s getting done).
            </p>
            <p>Essentially, this is when the “saying no to something is saying yes to something else” comes in clutch
                (may have heard that from AR). I’m using so much of the work-reward curve and the “saying no can also be
                saying yes” optimizations right now. Also, when I say “saying no is yes” for optimizing, I mean saying
                no doing more than 10 minutes for busywork when it can be done in 5 for the same reward.
            </p>
            <p>Now I only have 2 days for homework (especially physics), and I spent one of them on this thing and the
                trading bot. What may be the reward for it?
            </p>
            <p>Hmm? What reward?
            </p>
            <p>Alright, now at this point I may be just making stuff up, but I have to mention the “less is more”
                optimization. I’ll just say that after the ~390 liked songs became a 166 songs playlist, the skip rate
                went from 8:1 to 0.1:1 (the source that backs these statistics up: they’re made up).
            </p>
            <p>“10,000 to be an expert” (you may have heard of it before). While that’s true to some degree, they’re
                some other aspects to it. However, we’re gonna be talking 10 hours a day to reach 10,000 hours in a few
                years (10,000 hours of talking to be a CEO is the phrase they say, according to sources).
            </p>
            <p>(source is me)
            </p>
            <p>And you know, we could edit this article, but you know, there may be physics to do.
            </p>
            <p>(And also the trading bot).
            </p>
            <p>And of course, while there’s all this talk of diminishing returns, there’s no talk for getting
                comfortable/stopping (continuous grind for the daily 10 hour talking).

            I’ve seen what TZ meant by “whatever I write here, I imagine that people I meet in the future might read it beforehand, so I try to keep that in mind” (I paraphrased that).

If you're curious about solving the absurd art requirement, simply just sign up for the drawing class as soon as your freshman year starts (the earlier the year the better), then as soon as the course is posted on Schoology, check the students tab. Based on the results, there may need to be an immediate dip, or you're lucky initially and actually have an art class with friends that actually make such a filler class alright. Essentially, this way you’ll get like 4 chances to have an art class with friends that actually make such a filler class alright (at least 1 out of the 11 filler classes you’ll probably have someone you know there).

And I can’t believe that my free period is being replaced by such a filler class (health being assigned the 3rd time). And it’s absolutely insane that my class with AZ is being replaced. How could one attack a man this much?

Something I’ve heard before is that first you want to get into the meeting, then you want to be the one to host it, then you don’t want to be in them.

So we’re going out of the market competition by having the trading bot do the checking for us.

(This picture is of version 8. We’ll test the future version (version 10) in paper trading through the pine editor. Essentially version 10 will add the choices the algorithm makes based on where the point values are in regards to the neckline throughout a certain length that's proportional to the head shoulders pattern length. We’ll also make it so it shows all the head and shoulders patterns in the graph. Also, there’ll be an option to either show the most prominent shoulder (the one closest to the head that meets the “width and height range” and vertical threshold requirements within the “horizontal range”) or all the possible shoulders for the corresponding head).

As for the tech competition, we’re actually going to get an internship for the “arms race.” When you have people already planning their resume for FAANG at around age 10 (source: TZ’s article), you better not sit down and then let them run past you as they’ve clearly heard the saying of “10 years ago was the best time to start, the 2nd best time is now” (probably people starting at birth too).

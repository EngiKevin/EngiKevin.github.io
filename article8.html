            Remove every course in high school: we only need english, computer science, math, and finance. Literally not trying to take health for the 5th year in a row, literally a recipe for kids to dip foddy because of putting them in such an L situation. I know no one is trying to listen to a 50 minute yap session about being healthy. In addition, whatever is being covered this year in health should have been covered in the last 4 years. If something takes 5 years to learn, that‚Äôs crazy. And for mandarin/world language, do not tell me the exact curriculum for every single lesson, for every single year, it is just memorizing 10 characters the day before (or 20 minutes before for me personally) and writing it on the test. Like bro if being in a class that's supposedly seen as a ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù course has gotten so diluted to the point where it‚Äôs 80% filler, as in you walk in and just hear some 50 minute yap about the 10 characters you need to memorize (which only takes like 20 minutes) and then other chinese characters that are completely unneeded. As a Chinese person, I get that I already speak the language (aka I do not have to put effort into it), but literally if you know how to speak, that‚Äôs already 90% of the benefits you can get out of learning Chinese. And kinda crazy how everyone was told individually in person by the teacher they‚Äôd get recommended for AP mandarin, but the bro teacher literally switched up/backpealed and gave everyone the recommendation for regular mandarin. Like even the student who traveled from China to come here got recommended for mandarin 5. Like bro even the recommendations are getting wack. And do not tell me somehow they messed up PE, a class that could actually be fun and engaging by letting students do actual fun sports and activities. As Cooper P. states, ‚Äúnot trying to do some goofy ah volleyball but something not boring.‚Äù like no way they somehow messed that up. Honestly, the mandatory art requirement is wild: there‚Äôs a reason why most people take photography since they know it‚Äôs basically a free effortless class, and everyone taking art just has not heard about photography. What I‚Äôm about to say might be gatekeeped, but the way to cheat the art credit is essentially if you‚Äôre a freshman, immediately sign up for photography, but immediately dip foddy if there‚Äôs no friends in the members list. This way you get at least 4 chances for a chill class. The fact that people only do this for art says something (well I guess it‚Äôs the only ‚Äúclass‚Äù they can really do it for). Now for biology and chemistry, remove them. Like this might be biased and all, but I‚Äôve always consistently put effort for stem courses, and I‚Äôm saying to remove some of them, imagine what other students think or get out of it (L biology tbh).
        </p>
        <p>Now for the remaining courses, keep the electives as they‚Äôre personally chosen by students by choice. Obviously we‚Äôre keeping English‚Äîyou might hear the occasional ‚Äúoh why did school not teach us taxes and bills,‚Äù but take away English and it‚Äôll be ‚Äúwhy did school not teach us how to speak and write‚Äù if they can still write that: can‚Äôt be taking away one of the most foundational/cannon classes. Keeping math sorta just feels right (I want to hear no haters on math, I‚Äôll be using pythagorean theorem daily). Computer science is my elective choice.
        </p>
        <p>However, while removing fodder courses can be beneficial to an extent, they should be replaced with more meaningful ones. School came in clutch this time though by actually listening to the ‚Äúwhy are doing taxes not taught but mitochondria is.‚Äù So essentially now we have a personal finance requirement, but if something useful is going to be added, why not add to that by removing swimming class (removing a negative) tbh on crip cuh no cap. 
        </p>
        <p>Ok, quite a controversial take, but I‚Äôm saying to remove history. Tbh do not need english 2.0 but with the ‚Äúoh but knowing the past can help you not make the same mistake in the future‚Äù justification all while the holocaust is being taught ü§®.
        </p>
        <p>I must confess, I really only put the history section above just for extra words.

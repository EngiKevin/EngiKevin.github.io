            <p>            Ok, so there’s the first stage of leetcode in which you may think “oh hey, I’m literally about to finish this in 20 minutes, this medium problem should have been labeled easy...” But then you submit it and to see it passed 2/20 of the test cases. So, this is when stage 2 starts, and not everyone makes it out of stage 2 (took me ~3 hours to get out of stage 2 today). And yes, I know the advice is after 30 minutes you should view the solution, and you’re actually probably better off doing that instead. 
            </p>

<p>I’ll keep that in mind…
</p>
<p>Stage 2 may not be about simply solving the problem. No, if that were the case I’d be seeing green text. As because even if you were to pass all 333 test cases, it must be optimized enough (preferably O(0.1)). Otherwise, there’ll be no green text.
</p>
<p>Of course, I’m pretty sure this all gets naturally solved once you do at least 150 leetcode problems. 
</p>
<p>Also, speaking of leetcode: don’t do leetcode.
</p>
<p>wait what?!
</p>
<p>Wait okok, what I mean about that is it’s better to go the project route before leetcode (possibly AR recommended).

Checks the portfolio requirement for resume
Unlike Leetcode, you won’t be penalized for not doing a day (could lose 30 leetcoins!), so it’s more flexible
You learn skills sorta comfortably rather than feeling “forced.” (such as feeling the need to learn dps in under 3 hours as otherwise you’ll won’t have a 30 day streak for the 30 leetcoins)

Leetcode route:

At some point, you realize Leetcode is just using some sort of algorithm (ex. Bubble sort), but just knowing which one to use. 
Once you Leetcode, it’s only Leetcode

</p>
<p>Oh, also I think Leetcode gives you a “free” hat after ~900 consecutive days of doing the daily problem. I wonder how many hats have been sent.
